I’m a software programmer with a love for the world of computers. since my early ages, always learning, experimenting, and creating. 
All the way to and through my military service - working on classified, high complexity projects while using OOP, C#, Python and more. 
In addition to programming, the love of taking big responsibilities and team leading had taken place. 
Discovering new ideas and group efforts, while progressing to something bigger than us, that something: team work!

When I’m not on the job, I love surfing, hiking, wood-working and volunteering while always finding new ways to keep myself busy and entertained.

An example to one of the volunteer works which have taken a big place of my life due to COVID-19 outbreak. Had the privilege of leading a configuration technical team:
