While doing the INT(Israel National Trail) in the winter I was faced with a mobile service problem that couldn't allow me to check for floods.
Rented a satelite phone that only recieves SMS and Wrote a script that uses Webscraping to access temprature and floods data from https://ims.gov.il/.
checks 2-days in for floods - if condition is true, sends message to satelite phone that I am carrying in the field.
